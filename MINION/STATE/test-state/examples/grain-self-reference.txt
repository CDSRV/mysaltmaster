MATCHING GRAINS IN THE TOP FILE
With correctly setup grains on the Minion, the Top file used in Pillar or during Highstate can be made really efficient. Like for example, you could do:

'node_type:web':
    - match: grain
    - webserver

'node_type:postgres':
    - match: grain
    - database

'node_type:redis':
    - match: grain
    - redis

'node_type:lb':
    - match: grain
    - lb
For this example to work, you would need the grain node_type and the correct value to match on. 
This simple example is nice, but too much of the code is similar.
To go one step further, we can place some Jinja template code into the Top file.

{% set self = grains['node_type'] %}

    'node_type:{{ self }}':
        - match: grain
        - {{ self }}
